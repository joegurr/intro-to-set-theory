# A 5 Minute Introduction to Sets and Their Intersections

A set is a collection of "things".

What "things" you may ask? Almost anything you'd like ... For today we are going to consider just sets of numbers.

We **explicitly** write a set by enclosing the collection the "things" inside $\{\text{brackets}\}$ with commas separating the different objects.

**e.g.** we say that $\{17, 42, 108\}$ is a set

**e.g.** so is $\{\cdots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \cdots \}$

---

We can also write a definition of a set in words.

**e.g.** let $A$ be the set of even integers

**e.g.** or let $B$ be the set of roots to the equation $x^2 + 8x + 15$.

---

We can combine two sets in different ways to create a new set.

One of those ways is to **Intersect** two sets.

That is, we can create a new set by taking just the common elements of the original two sets.

We call the resulting set the **Intersection** of the two sets.

---

**e.g.** If we had a set $A = \{11, 100, 4\}$ and a set $B = \{8, 100, 3, 11\}$ then the intersection of those sets would be $\{100, 11\}$

We write the intersection of two sets $A$ and $B$ as $A \cap B$

We can visualise the intersection of two sets like this:


## Problems

1.  Let A be the set of positive whole numbers that are factors of 18 and let B be a positive whole number less than 6. What is $A \cap B$?


$A = \{1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18\}$

$B = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$

$A \cap B = \{1, 2, 3\}$

2. Let $P$ be the set of multiples of 3 between 1 and 20 and $Q$ be the set of even natural numbers up to 15. Find the intersection of the two given sets $P$ and set $Q$.

$P = \{3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18\}$

$Q = \{2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 ,14\}$

$P \cap Q = \{6, 12\}$
